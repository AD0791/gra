## 🛡️ STOP LOSS POSITIONING (OHLC-BASED)

The SL is placed **WITHIN the candle structure** based on tier.  
Wider SL for bigger moves, tighter SL for scalps.

### 📈 LONG TRADE STOP LOSS

- `[S/A/B]` = Tier badge  
- `─────` = Stop Loss line (at OHLC level)

- ☐ Points ≥ 10 (B-tier minimum)
- ☐ Volume ≥ 1.3x average
- ☐ Delta dominance ≥ 55%
- ☐ Candle direction = Delta direction
- ☐ In session (if filter ON)

> ⚠️ **ANY condition FALSE = NO SIGNAL = NO TRADE**

## 📋 TRADING BY TIER

### 🥇 S-TIER (100+ points)

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **SL Position** | At wick extreme (LOW for long, HIGH for short) |
| **Entry** | Candle close |
| **Stop** | SL line (DO NOT MOVE CLOSER) |
| **Action** | HOLD LONGER |

**Management:**
- Watch next candle
- Continues? → HOLD
- Same tier same direction? → ADD
- Reverses? → EXIT on close

> 💡 **Why wide SL:** This is institutional movement. Fake-outs are common. Give it room.

---

### 🥈 A-TIER (50-99 points)

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **SL Position** | Mid-wick (halfway between body and wick extreme) |
| **Entry** | Candle close |
| **Stop** | SL line |
| **Action** | HOLD A BIT |

**Management:**
- Target 1:1 R:R minimum
- Trail to breakeven if continues
- Stalls? → Take profit
- Reverses? → EXIT

> 💡 **Why mid-wick SL:** Good move but not exceptional. Balance between room and risk.

---

### 🥉 B-TIER (10-49 points)

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **SL Position** | Just beyond body (BODY LOW for long, BODY HIGH for short) |
| **Entry** | Candle close |
| **Stop** | SL line |
| **Action** | CLOSE QUICK |

**Management:**
- Target 5-10 points MAX
- Exit in 1-3 candles
- DO NOT hold
- Any doubt? → EXIT

> 💡 **Why tight SL:** Small move, small risk. Quick scalp and get out.

## ⚠️ AVOIDING FAKE-OUTS

Futures **WILL** try to shake you out. The SL system is designed to keep you in winning trades and out of losing ones.

**1. SL IS BASED ON STRUCTURE**
- Not arbitrary — based on actual candle OHLC
- **Wick** = where price was rejected
- **Body** = where price accepted value

**2. TIER DETERMINES SL WIDTH**
- Big move (S) = wide SL (wick)
- Medium move (A) = medium SL (mid-wick)
- Small move (B) = tight SL (body)

**3. IF SL HITS, IT MEANS:**
- The structure that gave the signal is broken
- The move has failed
- **GET OUT** — the signal was wrong

**4. DO NOT:**
- ❌ Move SL closer (you'll get stopped on noise)
- ❌ Move SL further (you'll take bigger losses)
- ❌ Ignore SL (you'll blow up)

## 💰 THE GOLDEN RULE

> ### **LEAVE EVERY TRADE WITH MONEY**
>
> | Tier | Rule |
> |:-----|:-----|
> | B-Tier | Small win > Small loss |
> | A-Tier | Trail to breakeven, lock in profit |
> | S-Tier | Let it run, but use the SL |
>
> **SL hit** = Capital preserved = Trade tomorrow  
> **Target hit** = Money made = Trade tomorrow
