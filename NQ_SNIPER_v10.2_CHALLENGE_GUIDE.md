3. Intrabar status shows **✅ ACTIVE**
4. Score is **9.5+/10**
5. Background turns **AQUA** (confirms GOD MODE)

### ❌ NEVER TRADE WHEN:
1. Signal is anything other than GOD MODE S-TIER
2. Session shows "OFF-HOURS"
3. Intrabar shows "⚠️ Invalid"
4. You've already lost $200 today (DAILY LIMIT)
5. You're emotional or revenge trading

## 💰 POSITION SIZING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: SURVIVAL ($48,299 → $48,600)
```
Contracts: 1 MNQ ONLY
Risk: $20 per trade (10 points × $2)
Reward: $60 per trade (30 points × $2)
Goal: Build $300+ buffer first
```

### Phase 2: GROWTH ($48,600 → $50,000)
```
Contracts: 1-2 MNQ (scale up after 3 consecutive wins)
Risk: $20-40 per trade
Reward: $60-120 per trade
```

### Phase 3: ACCELERATION ($50,000 → $53,000)
```
Contracts: 2-3 MNQ (you have buffer now)
Risk: $40-60 per trade
Reward: $120-180 per trade
```

## ⏰ TRADING SCHEDULE (ET TIME)

### 🇬🇧 LONDON OPEN (3:00 - 5:00 AM ET)
```
Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Volume: HIGH
Best for: Breakout trades
Watch for: European news, reversals from Asian session
```

### 🇺🇸 NY OPEN (9:30 - 11:30 AM ET)
```
Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (BEST)
Volume: HIGHEST
Best for: Trend continuation, high-probability setups
Watch for: Opening range, economic data releases
```

### ⚠️ AVOID THESE TIMES:
- 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM ET (Lunch - Low volume, choppy)
- 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM ET (After hours - Wide spreads)
- Major news events (CPI, FOMC, NFP) - TOO VOLATILE

---

## 📊 RANGE BAR READING CHEATSHEET

### Fast Bar Printing = INSTITUTIONAL ENTRY
```
Bar prints in < 3 seconds → AGGRESSIVE flow, potential signal
Bar prints in < 10 seconds → Active flow, watch for setup
Bar prints in > 30 seconds → Low activity, avoid trading
```

### Wick Analysis on Range Bars
```
NO WICKS = Pure momentum, institutions in control
LOWER WICK on BULL bar = Absorption (buyers absorbing sellers)
UPPER WICK on BEAR bar = Absorption (sellers absorbing buyers)
WICKS BOTH SIDES = Indecision, AVOID
```

### Consecutive Bar Count
```
5+ same direction, no wicks = STRONG TREND, ride it
3-4 same direction = Developing move, watch for entry
1-2 then reversal = CHOP, stay out
```

---

## 🎯 TRADE EXECUTION CHECKLIST

Before EVERY trade, confirm:

```
□ Signal is GOD MODE S-TIER (🔥Gˢ)?
□ Score is 9.5+ / 10?
□ Session is LONDON or NY OPEN?
□ Intrabar shows ✅ ACTIVE?
□ I haven't hit daily loss limit ($200)?
□ I'm not revenge trading?
□ My stop loss is set BEFORE entry?
□ Using only 1 MNQ (until buffer > $500)?
```

ALL boxes checked? → TAKE THE TRADE
Any box unchecked? → NO TRADE, WAIT

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "No signals appearing"
- Check session filter (must be London/NY Open)
- Check intrabar TF is valid for your chart
- Lower charts may have fewer signals (this is normal)

### "Intrabar shows ⚠️ Invalid"
- For 1000R chart: Use 100R, 10R, or 1R intrabar
- For 5M chart: Use 1M, 2M, or 3M intrabar
- Intrabar MUST be lower than chart TF

### "Signal appeared but I missed it"
- DON'T chase! Wait for next signal
- Signals on confirmed bars only (safer)
- There will always be another opportunity

## 💎 FINAL WORDS

**You have one job: PROTECT THE ACCOUNT.**

- $4,701 profit over 20 trading days = $235/day average
- That's 4 winning trades at $60 each
- With 70% win rate, you need ~6 trades/day
- BUT with GOD MODE, aim for 2-3 HIGH QUALITY trades

**Quality over quantity. Patience over aggression.**

The market will always be there tomorrow.
Your funded account won't be if you blow it today.

**TRUST THE SYSTEM. FOLLOW THE RULES. WIN.**
